## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of CSS Grid and responsive design techniques. I particularly focused on controlling the grid layout at different breakpoints for optimal display on smaller and larger screens.

### Continued development

For future projects, I'd like to explore more advanced CSS Grid techniques and incorporate animations to enhance the user experience. Additionally, I plan to work more with responsive typography and adaptive color schemes to further improve accessibility.
